# Write a function that, when given a string, will return an uppercase string with each letter shifted forward in the alphabet by however many spots the cipher was initialized to.
#
# If something in the string is not in the alphabet (e.g. punctuation, spaces), simply leave it as is.
# The shift will always be in range of [1, 26].
#
# For example:
# solution_kata_07(5, 'WAFFLES'); // returns 'BFKKQJX'


function solution_kata_07($shift, $nb_lane) {
    //
    // Your code here
    //
    return;
}
